Afrobeats have come a long way since the beginning of the decade. The genre has progressed so fast in such a short time that Afrobeats artists are becoming mainstream in the global music industry.

It goes without saying that Afrobeats producers are the driving force behind this movement as they are the ones creating the sound that's shaping the narrative in the industry. Unfortunately, professionalism isn't always the order of the day when dealing with some Afrobeats artists. We also have to admit that some artists just simply refuse to do their due diligence and often go head-first into a negotiation without knowing what to actually expect.

The great thing about this problem is that there is a solution. 

Trakjungle is a platforms that abstracts all of the inner workings of a production deal between an artist and producer and ensures that artists are not receiving the short end of the stick during a negotiation.

As an artist, you no longer have to worry about what licenses comes with the instrumental you intend to purchase. All you have to do is sign up on TrakJungle, listen to a wide variety of instrumentals, make a choice, make a payment and get your files.

TrakJungle ensures that you get all you deserve from producers such as:

\- Split Sheet

\- Licence Agreement

\- Trackouts in .wav

\- .mp3 sample

In addition, TrakJungle is not only useful for artists but for producers alike. Producers can upload their tracks alongside the trackouts then sit back and watch the money roll in.
